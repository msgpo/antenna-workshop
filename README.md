This repo contains research and materials for the [sudo mesh](https://sudomesh.org) Antenna Design Workshop.

The workshop was inspired by [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drwGvATLNaw), the availability of [the cheap N1201SA antenna analyzer](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=N1201SA) and a need for more hands-on learning experiences at our recurring [Build Your Own Internet](https://buildyourowninter.net/) workshops.

# Antenna designs

Information on viable antenna designs is in the `ANTENNA_DESIGN.md` file.

# Description

This is the description as written in the grant proposal:

Participants will cut conductive copper tape into shapes and stick it onto plain FR4 (circuitboard material). They will then get to test the resonance frequency of their improvised PCB and wire antennas using a Vector Network Analyzer and perform a rough check of antenna directionality by hooking them up to a transmitter and pointing them at different strategically placed directional receivers. We expect much testing and re-tweaking of shapes to get the resonance frequency just right.

We'll include a very brief presentation on guidelines for making different kinds of antennas and have volunteers to answer questions throughout.

This workshop won't require any prior experience and be open to all ages (under 18 to be accompanied by a parent or guardian). Everything but the copper tape and wire will be re-usable for later workshops.

For anyone interested we'll have a follow-up session for translating the designs into KiCAD and ordering them from a PCB manufacturing company.

## What are the project goals?

The main goal is to engage some of the local community in thinking about a part of our communications infrastructure that's usually invisible, and hopefully to learn something and have fun along the way. We want to convey a sense that the technologies we rely on every day for our internet connectivity are not out of reach for improvement and creative modification by individuals and small groups.

We will document the experience on our blog and wiki, including how many attendees we have and how many antenna prototypes were built and tested. We'll also provide material to help others who want to run a similar workshop.

A secondary goal is to test the viability of this method of rapid PCB antenna prototyping for e.g. open hardware projects by getting a sense of the difference between the hand-prototyped antennas and the equivalent professionally manufactured antennas.

## Who will it benefit?

This will benefit anyone local to the SF Bay Area interested in how wireless sig
nals and antennas work. Based on attendence at previous events we expect a wide 
range of experience levels from young kids to licensed HAM radio operators. 

We'll document this effort on our wiki and blog to make it easy for others to set up a similar antenna workshop, and we'll share our successes and failures so others can improve upon the experience. We expect that this method of prototyping antennas is relatively unknown and may also be of use to more seasoned eletronics engineers. We hope to provide actual numbers on the deviation between "copper tape on plain FR4" and the same design manufactured by a PCB manufacturing facility.
